# React + Vite üì¶

## Project Structure

- `node_modules/` - Contains all required packages & nested dependencies (e.g., babel, eslint)
- `src/assets/` - Recommended location for static assets (avoid using `public/`)
- ESLint configured for syntax error detection

## Key Files

### index.html

Contains minimal structure with:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

### Other Files

- `README.md` - Project documentation & team information
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration settings

## Dependencies

- **DevDependencies**: Libraries needed only during development
- **Dependencies**: Core packages required in both development & production

## React History

- Developed by Jordan Walke (2011)
- Meta Adoption Timeline:
  - Messenger (2011)
  - Instagram (2012)
  - Open-sourced (2013)

> npm is world's largest package registry

## React Architecture üèóÔ∏è

```
index.html  <=  Main.jsx  <=  App.jsx  <=  demo.jsx  <=  demo1.jsx
                                                     <=  demo2.jsx
```

### Key Concepts

- `createRoot()` introduced in (React 18+)
  - Creates foundation for virtual DOM
  - Replaces older `ReactDOM.render()`

### Rendering Process

- `main.jsx` renders `App.jsx`
- Render method handles:
  - Diffing algorithm
  - Reconciliation
  - DOM updates in `index.html#root`

### Important Notes

- The `render` method initiates the process
- Reconciler manages diffing & reconciliation internally
- Transpilation handled by build tools (e.g., Babel) and not by render method
- Global CSS in `main.jsx` affects all nested components
- `StrictMode` (Development only)
  - Detects double-rendering
  - Identifies unexpected side effects
  - Optional wrapper

> Component architecture follows this structure for optimal performance

_Note: JavaScript logic goes inside component functions but outside return()_


### npx

- npx is node package executable
- npx will download only necessary packages and remaining pkg we can access without downloading them
- eg Fb in mobile 2 ways - download fb app(similar to npm way) download and use
                         - downloading the browser(necessary pkg) not downloading fb but downlaoding necessary pkg(browser) and exec fb on that pkg

### npm (Node Package Manager):

- Primary package manager for Node.js
- Used to install and manage project dependencies
- Installs packages globally or locally
- Manages packages listed in package.json
- Used for permanent package installations
- Example: npm install express
- Packages are stored in node_modules
- Used for project dependencies management

<br/>
### npx (Node Package Execute):

- Package runner tool that comes with npm
- Executes packages without installing them globally
- Runs one-off commands/packages temporarily
- Downloads packages when needed, then removes them
- Ensures using latest version of packages
- Example: npx create-react-app my-app
- Avoids global package pollution
- Great for executing packages you'll use occasionally
- npx create-react-app myapp -- start command -- npm start (NOT RECOM)
- index.js is similar to main.jsx in vite wrapps app component
