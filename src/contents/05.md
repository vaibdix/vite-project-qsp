## Lifecycle methods -- Compulsory Question

1. These tell about lifecycle of any component .
2. Are divided into 3
   - mounting
   - updating
   - unmounting
3. Lifecycle methods are default available in class based component only.
4. Function based component does not provide any default lifecycle method. If we want to achieve Lifecycle methods in function based components we can take help of hook like useEffect.
5. 3 Phases of lifecycle methods represent unique lifespan of component like
   1. Mounting
      - How component is created
      - How to render it on UI
        - constructor()
          - will execute first
          - will execute only once
          - place for initialization of variables and states - it exec only 1, so same state or variables will not get reinitialize again
        - getDerivedStateFromProps()
          - execs after constructor
          - used to accept props from parent component
          - js logic inside getDerivedStateFromProps()
        - render()
          - execs after getDerivedStateFromProps()
          - has return statement, returns jsx
          - used to display jsx on UI
          -
        - componentDidMount()
          - exec after render() .
          - eg. API calling
          - executes only once
          - once jsx is rendered react can perform heavy computations or **sideEffects**.
          - multiple sideEffects are fetching, network related operations, DOM.
          - if performing/handling sideffects in componentDidMount() after render(), render() method can execute faster before this method which will help to enhance user experience.
   2. Updating
      - If user performs any action/task
      - Like click, hover, form submission.
      - Methods
        - getDerivedStateFromProps()
          - Receives props from parent elements
          - also has info about current state
          - can exec n no. of times
        - shouldComponentUpdate()
          - has info on curr and prev state
          - if there are any changes in curr and prev state it will return true or returns false.
          - if these methods return true then only remaining methods of updating phase will get executed.
          - Returns bolean val depending prev state and current state.
          - If difference found then next methods will performs.
        - getSnapdshotBeforeUpdate()
          - execs only if shouldComponentUpdate() returns true.
          - this method stores prev val of state with it and we can use it if required.
        - render()
          - puts updated state on UI
        - componentDidUpdate()
          - checks changes in state and based on that it will handle sideEffects.
          - executes only once
   3. Unmounting
      - has only 1 method ie. component should unmount
      - this method returns a function in which we can stop or clear ongoing task
      - occurs if user navigates from one component to another component
        - componentWillUnmount()
          - will be used to clear ongoing task into curr component before navigating to another component.
          - eg. if you have setInterval() in curr component we can clear that interval in this method before we navigate to another component
