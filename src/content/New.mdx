# React + Vite üì¶

## Project Structure

- `node_modules/` - Contains all required packages & nested dependencies (e.g., babel, eslint)
- `src/assets/` - Recommended location for static assets (avoid using `public/`)
- ESLint configured for syntax error detection

## Key Files

### index.html

Contains minimal structure with:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

### Other Files

- `README.md` - Project documentation & team information
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration settings

## Dependencies

- **DevDependencies**: Libraries needed only during development
- **Dependencies**: Core packages required in both development & production

## React History

- Developed by Jordan Walke (2011)
- Meta Adoption Timeline:
  - Messenger (2011)
  - Instagram (2012)
  - Open-sourced (2013)

> npm is world's largest package registry

## React Architecture üèóÔ∏è

```
index.html  <=  Main.jsx  <=  App.jsx  <=  demo.jsx  <=  demo1.jsx
                                                     <=  demo2.jsx
```

### Key Concepts

- `createRoot()` introduced in (React 18+)
  - Creates foundation for virtual DOM
  - Replaces older `ReactDOM.render()`

### Rendering Process

- `main.jsx` renders `App.jsx`
- Render method handles:
  - Diffing algorithm
  - Reconciliation
  - DOM updates in `index.html#root`

### Important Notes

- The `render` method initiates the process
- Reconciler manages diffing & reconciliation internally
- Transpilation handled by build tools (e.g., Babel) and not by render method
- Global CSS in `main.jsx` affects all nested components
- `StrictMode` (Development only)
  - Detects double-rendering
  - Identifies unexpected side effects
  - Optional wrapper

> Component architecture follows this structure for optimal performance

_Note: JavaScript logic goes inside component functions but outside return()_


### npx

- npx is node package executable
- npx will download only necessary packages and remaining pkg we can access without downloading them
- eg Fb in mobile 2 ways - download fb app(similar to npm way) download and use
                         - downloading the browser(necessary pkg) not downloading fb but downlaoding necessary pkg(browser) and exec fb on that pkg

npm (Node Package Manager):
1. Primary package manager for Node.js
2. Used to install and manage project dependencies
3. Installs packages globally or locally
4. Manages packages listed in package.json
5. Used for permanent package installations
6. Example: npm install express
7. Packages are stored in node_modules
8. Used for project dependencies management
9.

npx (Node Package Execute):
1. Package runner tool that comes with npm
2. Executes packages without installing them globally
3. Runs one-off commands/packages temporarily
4. Downloads packages when needed, then removes them
5. Ensures using latest version of packages
6. Example: npx create-react-app my-app
7. Avoids global package pollution
8. Great for executing packages you'll use occasionally
9. npx create-react-app myapp -- start command -- npm start (NOT RECOM)
10. index.js is similar to main.jsx in vite wrapps app component
