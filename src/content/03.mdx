- write once use anywhere
- can create components for such fxns that are repetative(button component) - repeat component n times
- it is declarative in nature. eg - no dom methods writing as everything is already declared with JSX
- we can call react as declarative
  - becoz react provides many inbuilt hooks for different functionalities we just have to use 'em

#### Difference between declarative and imperative approach
- declarative (JSX) -- dont have to write DOM manipulations(everything is declared just have to use it)
- imperative   (JS) -- have to mention steps to do DOM manipulations(everything needs to mentioned explicitly)
