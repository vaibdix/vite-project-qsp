#### HMR - Hot mpdule reload
- hmr is one of the features offered by webpack it allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without full refresh
- hmr is not used in production


#### Features or char of react
- it follows component based architecture

|                <Navbar />                |

- write once use anywhere
- can create components for such fxns that are repetative(button component) - repeat component n times
- it is declarative in nature. eg - no dom methods writing as everything is already declared with JSX
- we can call react as declarative
  - becoz react provides many inbuilt hooks for different functionalities we just have to use 'em

#### Difference between declarative and imperative approach
- declarative (JSX) -- dont have to write DOM manipulations(everything is declared just have to use it)
- imperative   (JS) -- have to mention steps to do DOM manipulations(everything needs to mentioned explicitly)

#### REACT MAINTAINS 2 VIRTUAL DOMS -
- 1. OLD VIRTUAL DOM
- 2. NEW VIRTUAL DOM
- whenever there is a change in the state of the component, react compares the old virtual dom with the new virtual dom and updates
  only the part of the dom that has changed instead of updating the whole dom tree which makes react faster

#### PROPS(Properties)
- eg. adding item to cart -- App.jsx -> Header.jsx -> Cart.jsx
- sending data from parent to child component.
- data send is in form of object and is not mutable
- present in both fxn based and class bases components
- can send multiple props in object
- can send multiple props in to same component
- data send is always unidirectional

| Question                      | Props                                        | State                                              |

| What is it?                   | External data passed into components         | Internal data managed within a component           |
| Can it be modified?           | No (Read-only)                               | Yes (Mutable)                                      |
| Control                       | Controlled by whatever renders the component | Controlled by the component itself                 |
| Updates                       | Can only be updated by parent components     | Can be updated using setState()                    |
| Performance                   | Changes in props trigger re-render           | Changes in state trigger re-render                 |
| Asynchronous?                 | No                                           | Yes (State updates may be asynchronous)            |
| Initial value set by?         | Parent component                             | Component itself                                   |
| Can be defaulted?             | Yes, using defaultProps                      | Yes, in constructor or with useState initial value |
| Used for?                     | Passing data down component tree             | Managing component's internal data                 |
| Functional components access? | Function parameters                          | useState Hook                                      |
| Class components access?      | this.props                                   | this.state                                         |
| Can compute from other values?| Yes, can be derived from other props         | Should be independent from props                   |
| Example use case?             | Passing user data, configurations            | Form inputs, toggles, counters                     |
| Update Syntax (Class)         | Not applicable                               | this.setState()                                    |
| Update Syntax (Functional)    | Not applicable                               | setState() from useState hook                      |
